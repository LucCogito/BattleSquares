## **Abstract**
A single level bullet hell game for browsers where you play as a square fending off other shapes using abilites gathered from defeating them.

## **Gameplay**
Player moves in a top-down fasion using keyboard, while aiming and casting abilities with mouse buttons. The arena is entirely contained within the screen, and the camera remains static. Enemies appear outside the view and move towards the player according to their movement methods. Every two minutes, a new unit is added in the set of spawned foes, until the 10th minute when spawning stops and a boss appears. The game ends with victory upon defeating the final enemy.

### Abilities
Upon defeat, foes may drop abilities that are autoeqiupped, at random in one of two slots, when moved over. Picking up already owned ability upgrades existing one instead, thus strategic loot pickup is important.

### Upgrades
Player can upgrade abilities in Main Menu using points gathered throughout the runs. These have no alternating paths nor complicated effects; just stat boosts.

## **Art Style**
Both scenery and user interface will follow a vector-simplistic theme with a touch of vibrant tones:

Enemy graphics and important elements should stand out both in color and shape, aiming for better player experiences and for color-blind individuals. The gameplay shall not include particle effects, camera movements, or flashing lights to ensure comfort even for more sensitive players.
